Welcome to Cookie Monster's first website.

About me.

Cookie Monster loves eating cookies and talking about himself in the third person. He is currently
learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the internet works, to creating
websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!

About coding.

Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
HTML is cool
CSS is stylish
JS is the best

What do you need to create a website?
Not much!

A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files
