            Welcome to Cookie Monster's first website.

            About me.

            Cookie Monster loves eating cookies and talking about himself in the third person. He is currently
            learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the internet works, to creating
            websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!

            About coding.

            Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
            HTML is cool
            CSS is stylish
            JS is the best

            What do you need to create a website?
            Not much!

            A computer (always a good start)
            A text editor (I am using atom)
            A web browser (I am using chrome)
            Some HTML, CSS and JS files
